# 🤖 Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Minimax Algorithm)

A simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Python where you play against an unbeatable AI using the **Minimax** algorithm.

## 📌 Features

- Play as `X` or `O`
- Human vs AI (AI uses the Minimax strategy)
- Draw detection
- Command-line UI with clear game display

## 🧠 How It Works

The AI uses the **Minimax** algorithm to evaluate all possible moves and always plays optimally. It guarantees at least a draw — you can only win if you never make a mistake (and even then, only if you go first!).

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Save the following code into a file called `tic_tac_toe.py`.
3. Run the file using:

   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe.py
